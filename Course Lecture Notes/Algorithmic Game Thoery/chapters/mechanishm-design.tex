\chapter{Introduction to Mechanism Design}
At a very high level, mechanism design is the question of how to design systems (algorithms) with strategic participants with good performance guarantees. In some sense, it's the “design” version of inefficiency of equilibria: instead of analyzing games, we want to design games so that rational agents will result in good global behavior. However, we don't necessarily think of the setup for mechanism design as a “game” in the way that we have been (even though it is!). Instead, the simplest setting to think about are auctions. We'll start with the simplest version possible, and later will move to more complicated versions.
