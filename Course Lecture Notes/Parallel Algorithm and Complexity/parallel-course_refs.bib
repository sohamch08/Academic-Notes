This chapter discusses parallel algorithms for shared-memory machines. Parallel computation is rapidly becoming a dominant theme in all areas of computer science and its applications. It is estimated that, within a decade, virtually all developments in computer architecture, systems programming, computer applications and the design of algorithms will be taking place within the context of parallel computation. In preparation for this revolution, theoretical computer scientists have begun to develop a body of theory centered on parallel algorithms and parallel architectures. As there is no consensus yet on the appropriate logical organization of a massively parallel computer, and as the speed of parallel algorithms is constrained as much by limits on interprocessor communication as it is by purely computational issues, it is not surprising that a variety of abstract models of parallel computation have been pursued. Closest to the hardware level are the VLSI models, which focus on the technological limits of today's chips, in which gates and wires are packed into a small number of planar layers.}

	abstract = { A relationship is established between (i) parallel random-access machines that allow many processors to concurrently read from or write into a common memory including simultaneous reading or writing into the same memory location (CROW PRAM), and (ii) combinational logic circuits that contain AND’s, OR’s and NOT’s, with no bound placed on the fan-in of AND-gates and OR-gates. Parallel time and number of processors for CROW PRAM’s are shown to correspond respectively (and simultaneously) to depth and size for circuits, where the time-depth correspondence is to within a constant factor and the processors-size correspondence is to within a polynomial. By applying a recent result of Furst, Saxe and Sipser, we obtain the corollary that parity, integer multiplication, graph transitive closure and integer sorting cannot be computed in constant time by a CROW PRAM with a polynomial number of processors. This is the first nonconstant lower bound on the parallel time required to solve these problems by a CROW PRAM with a polynomial number of processors. We also state and outline the proof of a similar result, due to W. L. Ruzzo and M. Tompa, that relates time and processor bounds for CRCW PRAM’S to alternation and space bounds for alternating Turing machines. }

	abstract = {We present a general framework for balancing expressions (terms) in the form of so-called tree straight-line programs. The latter can be seen as circuits over the free term algebra extended by contexts (terms with a hole) and the operations, which insert terms/contexts into contexts. In Ref. [16], it was shown that one can compute for a given term of size n in logspace a tree straight-line program of depth O(log n) and size O(n/ log n). In the present article, it is shown that the conversion can be done in DLOGTIME-uniform TC0. This allows reducing the term evaluation problem over an arbitrary algebra A to the term evaluation problem over a derived two-sorted algebra F (A). Three applications are presented: (i) an alternative proof for a recent result by Krebs et al. [25] on the expression evaluation problem is given; (ii) it is shown that expressions for an arbitrary (possibly non-commutative) semiring can be transformed in DLOGTIME-uniform TC0 into equivalent circuits of logarithmic depth and size O(n/ log n); and, (iii) a corresponding result for regular expressions is shown.},

It is shown that the configurational partition function of this system can be expressed in terms of a Pfaffian, and hence calculated explicitly, if the lattice graph is planar and if the dimers occupy all lattice sites. By the examples of the quadratic and the hexagonal lattice, it is found that the dimer system may show a phase transition similar to that of a two‐dimensional Ising model, or one of a different nature, or no transition at all, depending on the activities of various classes of bonds. The Ising problem is then shown to be equivalent to a generalized dimer problem, and a rederivation, of Onsager's expression for the Ising partition function of a rectangular lattice graph is sketched on the basis of this equivalence.}",
