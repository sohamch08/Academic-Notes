$Pf'$ orientation of $C_1$ and $Pf'$ orientation of $C_2$ yield a $Pf'$ orientation of $C_1\oplus C_2$
		
%Problem		
\end{problem}
	
\solve{
	%Solution
	For any simple cycle $C$ let $f$ be the number of edges in forward direction and $k$ be the number of  vertices strictly inside $C$. Then we will show if for $C_1$ and $C_2$ we have $f_1,k_1$ and $f_2,k_2$ respectively and $f_1+k_1\equiv 1\pmod2$ and $f_2+k_2\equiv 1\pmod2$ then so is for the cycle $C\coloneqq C_1\oplus C_2$.
	
 Now let the path $P$ shared by $C_1$ and $C_2$ contains $m$ vertices. So the number of vertices of $C$ is $k=k_1+k_2+b$. Since all the edges of $P$ is either in forward direction with respect to $C_1$ or $C_2$ if we take $f_1+f_2$ then this number has all the edges of $P$. So the number of edges in forward direction of $C$ is $f=f_1+f_2-(b+1)$. Hence $$k+f=(k_1+k_2+b)+(f_1+f_2-(b+1))=(k_1+f_1)+(k_2+f_2)-1\equiv 1\pmod2$$So we obtain a $Pf'$ orientation of $C_1\oplus C_2$

Given any matrix of univariate polynomials of degree $\leq n^{O(1)}$ then prove that the coefficent of $x^i$ in the determinant of the matrix is in $GapL$
	%Problem		
\end{problem}

\solve{
	%Solution
	Suppose the given matrix is $M$. Now we replace the entries of $M$ with new variables. So the $(i,j)$th entry of $M$ is replaced by the variable $x_{i,j}$. Suppose the new matrix obtained is $M'$. Now using Mahajan-Vinay's method we obtain an arithmetic branching program which computes the determinant of $M'$. Now in the $ABP$ we replace every $x_{i,j}$ with the $(i,j)$th polynomial in $M$. So this new $ABP$ now computed the determinant of $M$. Let the source vertex of this is $s$ and target vertex is $t$. Let $\deg(\det M)=d$.
	
	We will do now homogenization of the $ABP$. We will start from right. Apart from the target vertex of $ABP$ we replace each vertex $v$ of the $ABP$ with $d+1$ many vertices $v^{(0)},v^{(1)}, \dots, v^{(d)}$ going from right to left. Where $v^{(i)}$ computes the $\deg i$ term of the polynomial obtained from the $ABP$ by making $v$ the source vertex and the target vertex is same as before. Here by $v^{(i)}$ we mean that polynomial also. Thus the polynomial obtained by making $s^{(i)}$ the source vertex and target vertex $t$ same as before we get the coefficient of $x^i$ in $\det M$. 
	
	To homogenize let before there was an edge $(u,v)$ with weight $p(x)=a_dx^d+\cdots +a_1x+a_0$. Since $v$ is on right side of $u$, $v$ is replaced with $v^{(0)},v^{(1)}, \dots, v^{(d)}$. Now we first replace $u$ with $u^{(0)},u^{(1)}, \dots, u^{(d)}$. Now obviously we have $u^{(i)}=\sum\limits_{j=0}^i a_j x^j v^{(i-j)}$. So for $0\leq j\leq i$ we join the edges $(u^{(i)},v^{(i-j)})$ with weight $a_jx^j$. We keep on doing this from right to left. 
	
	In the end the source vertex is splited into $d+1$ vertices. Here $s^{(i)}$ computes the coefficient of $x^i$ in $\det M$ multiplied by $x^i$. Now if we replace the variable $x$ in this new homogenized $ABP$ with $1$ then we can say that $s^{(i)}$ computes the coefficient of $x^i$ in $\det M$. So now we reduced that coefficient of $x^i$ is $\det M$ is the value of the $ABP$ whose source vertex is $s^{(i)}$ and target vertex is $t$, same as before. Since $ABP$ is in $GapL$ we have coefficient of $x^i$ in $\det M$ is in $GapL$.

	Give a dicirculation of a bidirected graph $G$ using non-vanishing circulation
	
	%Problem		
\end{problem}

\solve{
	%Solution
	Let the bidirected graph is $G=(V,E)$. From $G$ we create a new graph  where for all $(u,v),(v,u)\in E$ we introduce a new vertex $t_{u,v}$ and the edges $\{u,t_{u,v}\}, \{t_{u,v}, v\}$. So this new graph call this $\tdG$. 
	
	Now let $\tdG$ has any non vanishing circulation. So for any edge $\{x,y\}\in E(\tdG)$ we denote the weight of the edge as $w(x,y)$. Now we define the weights in $G$ such that $$w'(u,v)=w(u,t_{u,v})-w(t_{u,v},v)$$ where $w'$ is the weight of the edge $(u,v)\in E$. We claim this is a dicirculation of $G$. To prove let $C$ be any cycle in $G$. Let $C=u_0u_1u_2\cdots u_{2k-1}u_1	$. Then $$w(C)=\sum_{e\in C}w(e)=\sum_{i=0}^{2k-1} w'(u_i, u_{i+1})=\sum_{i=0}^{2k-1} w(u_i, t_{u_i,u_{i+1}})-w(t_{u_i,u_{i+1}},v)\neq 0$$Since this is true for any cycle we obtain a dicirculation.
