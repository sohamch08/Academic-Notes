Prove that $GapNC^1=DiffNC^1$

		%Solution
		$GapNC^1$ is in $DiffNC^1$ because if $f-g\in GapNC^1$ then we can compute $f$ and $g$ normally and at the top there is a addition gate where the coefficient of $g$ is $-1$. So $GapNC^1\subseteq DiffNC^1$.
		
		Suppose $f\in DiffNC^1$. Now we will try to move the negative coefficients upwards and when it reaches to the children of the topmost gate we will transform it to the form of $g-h$. Since it is $DiffNC^1$ we can assume fanin is 2. If there are no $-1$ coefficients for any child of a gate we will do nothing. Now we can transform the gates like this
		\begin{align*}
			 & (-f)\times (-g)  = f\times g  &  & \text{remove the -1's from children}                                            \\
			 & (-f)\times g  = - (f\times g) &  & \text{remove the -1's from children and add to the edge outgoing from the gate} \\
			 & (-f)+(-g) = -(f+g)            &  & \text{remove the -1's from children and add to the edge outgoing from the gate}
		\end{align*}
	
	Apart from these cases one case is remaining. The last case is $(-f)+g$ Then suppose from the addition gate it is going to another gate $g$. Then we make two copies of $g$ where one has the child $-f$ and the other one has child $g$ in place of the original $-f+g$ in the single gate $g$. Then we do the process above again. 
	
	Now if $-f+g$ is the case where the $+$ is the topmost gate then we replace the $+$ gate with $-$ and the children of that gate will be $g$ and $f$ respectively. If $(-f)+(-g)$ is the case where the additoin gate is the topmost gate then compute it by $$(-f)+(-g)=1-1+(-f)+(-g)=1-(1+f+g)$$ Also if the $(-f)\times g$ is the topmost $\times$ gate then we compute it like $$(-f)\times g= -(f\times g)= 1-(1+f\times  g)$$So we replace the $(-f)\times g$ with $1-(1+fg\times g)$. 
	
	In this way the negative coefficients moves upwards and in the end we have a $h-k$ form at the top which satisfies the $GapNC^1$ conditions. Also with this reconstructing at most every gate is duplicated and at the top at most 1 more gate appeared. So  Size blow up is constant. Therefore $DiffNC^1\subseteq GapNC^1$. Hence $GapNC^1=DiffNC^1$.

	Formula depth reduction

\solve{
	%Solution
Suppose $\phi$ is a formula. Lets assume its fanin is 2. Suppose the size of $\phi$ is $s$.  Now starting from the root walk down to the leaves by aleays taking the child with a larger subtree under it. Consider the first node in this path $v$ such that the size of the formula rooted at $v$ is smaller than $\frac{2s}3$. Let $\phi_v$ be the subformula rooted at $v$, By the choice of the path from the root we have $$\frac{s}3 \leq |\phi_v|<\frac{2s}{3}$$Let $\phi'_v$ be the formula if the subformula rooted at $v$ is replaced by a variable $y$. Hence $$\phi'_v(y)=Ay+B\qquad \text{and} \phi=A\phi_v+B$$ for some polynomials $A$ and $B$. But we can compute both $A$ and $B$ from $\phi'_v(y)$ as $$A=\phi'_v(1)-\phi'_v(0)\qquad B=\phi'_v(0)$$Thus $$f=(\phi_v'(1)-\phi'_v(0))\phi_v+\phi_v'(0)$$All the formulas $\phi'_v(1)$, $\phi'_v(0)$, $\phi_v$ have size at most $\frac{2s}{3}$. Thus by recursvely applying the process on each of the subformulas we have $$Depth (s)=Depth\lt(\frac{2s}{3}\rt)+3\implies Depth(s)=O(\log s)$$and $$Size(s)\leq 4Size\lt(\frac{2s}{3}\rt)+O(1)\implies Size(s)=poly(s)$$
