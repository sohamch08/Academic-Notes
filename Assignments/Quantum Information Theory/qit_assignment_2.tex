	Let $S:\mcH\to \mcH$ where it maps the basis vectors from $\ket{e_i}\to \ket{f_i}$. Then $S\ket{e_i}=\ket{f_i}$.

Hence $$\ket{\psi}\tensor \ket{\phi}=\sum_{i=1}^d\alpha_{i}\ket{e_i}\tensor \ket{\phi}$$Now $\ket{\phi}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^d\beta_i\ket{f_i}$ where $\beta_i\in \bbC$ for all $i\in [d]$ since $\{\ket{f_i}\in \mcH_2\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ is ONB for $\mcH_2$.

	Show that the Pauli matrices are all Hermitian, unitary, they square to the identity, and their eigenvalues are $\pm 1$
	%Problem		
\end{problem}
\solve{
Pauli matrices are 
$$
	X\ket{0}=\ket{1},X\ket{1}=\ket{0}\qquad 
Y\ket{0}=-i\ket{1},Y\ket{1}=i\ket{0}\qquad 
Z\ket{0}=\ket{0},Z\ket{1}=-\ket{1}$$
Therefore we have 
$$
X=\ket{1}\bra{0}+\ket{0}\bra{1}\qquad 
Y=i[\ket{0}\bra{1}-\ket{1}\bra{0}]\qquad 
Z=\ket{0}\bra{0}-\ket{1}\bra{1}$$
Hence 
\begin{align*}
	X^{\dagger} & =(\ket{1}\bra{0})^{\dagger}+(\ket{0}\bra{1})^{\dagger}=\ket{0}\bra{1}+\ket{1}\bra{0}=X       \\
	Y^{\dagger} & =(i\ket{0}\bra{1})^{\dagger}+(-i\ket{1}\bra{0})^{\dagger}=-i\ket{1}\bra{0}+i\ket{0}\bra{1}=Y \\
	Z^{\dagger} & =(\ket{0}\bra{0})^{\dagger}-(\ket{1}\bra{1})^{\dagger}=\ket{0}\bra{0}-\ket{1}\bra{1}=Z
\end{align*}
Therefore they are Hermitian. 

Now \begin{align*}
	X^{\dagger}X=XX^{\dagger}=X^2& =\lt[ \ket{1}\bra{0}+\ket{0}\bra{1} \rt]\lt[ \ket{1}\bra{0}+\ket{0}\bra{1}  \rt]\\
	& = \ket{1}\bra{0}\ket{1}\bra{0}+\ket{1}\bra{0}\ket{0}\bra{1}+\ket{0}\bra{1}\ket{1}\bra{0}+\ket{0}\bra{1}\ket{0}\bra{1} \\
	& = \ket{1}\bra{1}+\ket{0}\bra{0}=I
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
	Y^{\dagger}Y=Y^{\dagger}=Y^2& =\lt[ i(\ket{0}\bra{1}-\ket{1}\bra{0}) \rt]\lt[ i(\ket{0}\bra{1}-\ket{1}\bra{0})  \rt]\\
	&=-\lt[ \ket{0}\bra{1}\ket{0}\bra{1}-\ket{0}\bra{1}\ket{1}\bra{0}-\ket{1}\bra{0}\ket{0}\bra{1}+\ket{1}\bra{0}\ket{1}\bra{0}\rt] \\
	& = \ket{0}\bra{0}+\ket{1}\bra{1}=I
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
	Z^{\dagger}Z=Z^{\dagger}=Z^2& =\lt[ \ket{0}\bra{0}-\ket{1}\bra{1} \rt]\lt[ \ket{0}\bra{0}-\ket{1}\bra{1} \rt]\\
	& =\ket{0}\bra{0}\ket{0}\bra{0}-\ket{0}\bra{0}\ket{1}\bra{1}-\ket{1}\bra{1} \ket{0}\bra{0}+\ket{1}\bra{1} \ket{1}\bra{1} \\
	& =\ket{0}\bra{0}+ \ket{1}\bra{1}=I
\end{align*}Therefore $X,Y,Z$ are unitary and they square to the identity.

Since $X\ket{0}=\ket{1}$ and $X\ket{1}=\ket{0}$ we have 
$$X\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0}+\ket{1}\rt)=\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{1}+\ket{0}\rt)\quad X\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0} -\ket{1}\rt)=\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{1}-\ket{0}\rt)=-\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0}-\ket{1}\rt)$$So the for the eigenvalue $1$ the corresponding eignevector is $\ket{+}=\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0}+\ket{1}\rt)$ and for the eigenvalue $-1$ the corresponding eigenvalue is $\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0}-\ket{1}\rt)$.

Since $Y\ket{0}=-i\ket{1}$ and $Y\ket{1}=i\ket{0}$ we have 
$$Y\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0}+i\ket{1}\rt)=\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(-i\ket{1}+i^2\ket{0}\rt) = -\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(i\ket{1}+\ket{0}\rt)$$ $$ Y\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0} -i\ket{1}\rt)=\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(-i\ket{1}-i^2\ket{0}\rt)=\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\lt(\ket{0}-i\ket{1}\rt)$$So the for the eigenvalue $1$ the corresponding eigenvector is $\ket{0} -i\ket{1}$ and for the eigenvalue $-1$ the corresponding eigenvalue is $\ket{0}+i\ket{1}$.

Since $Z\ket{0}=\ket{0}$ and $Z\ket{1}=-\ket{1}$. So the for the eigenvalue $1$ the corresponding eigenvector is $\ket{0}$ and for the eigenvalue $-1$ the corresponding eigenvalue is $\ket{1}$.

	 	\item Suppose $\{\ket{e_i}\in\mcH\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ is an ONB of $\mcH$. Let $T\in\sL(\mcH)$. Then for all $i\in [d]$ $$T\ket{e_i}=\sum_{j=1}^d\alpha_{i,j}\ket{e_j}$$ where $\alpha_{i,j}\in \bbC$. Hence, the map $T$ is uniquely decided by the numbers $\alpha_{i,j}\in \bbC$ for all $i,j\in [d]$. Hence, there are $d^2$ many numbers which uniquely decides $T$. Therefore $\dim(\sL(\mcH))= d^2$. 
	 
	\item Now let $T\in\sR(\mcH)$. Then $T^{\dagger}=T$. Again suppose $\{\ket{e_i}\in\mcH\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ is an ONB of $\mcH$. Let $(i,j)$th element of $T$ is denoted by $t_{i,j}$. Then for all $i\in [d]$, $T_{i,i}\in \bbR$ since $T^{\dagger}=T$. Now for all off diagonal entries $t_{j,i}=t^*_{i,j}$. So there are $\frac{n^2-n}2$ many complex numbers which decides $T$ uniquely apart from the $n$ real entries in the diagonal. Now for each $i,j\in[d]$ let  $t_{i,j}=x_{i,j}+iy_{i,j}$ where $x_{i,j},y_{i,j}\in  \bbR$. Therefore, $$t_{j,i}=t^*_{i,j}=x_{i,j}-iy_{i,j}$$So for each off-diagonal entries there are corresponding 2 real numbers. And there are total $\frac{d^2-d}2$ many off-diagonal entries which participates in uniquely deciding $T$. Hence there are total $$2\times \frac{d^2-d}2+d=d^2$$ real numbers which uniquely decides $T$. Hence $\dim(\sR(\mcH))= d^2$. 
	\item Suppose $\{\ket{e_i}\in\mcH\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ is a basis of $\mcH$. Let $T\in\sL(\mcH)$.

Hence, the map $T$ is uniquely decided by the numbers $\alpha_{i,j}\in \bbC$ for all $i,j\in [d]$. Since there are $d^2$ many numbers which uniquely decides $T$, $\dim(\sL(\mcH))= d^2$. 
	\item Let $T\in\sR(\mcH)$. Then $T^t=T$. Again suppose $\{\ket{e_i}\in\mcH\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ is an basis of $\mcH$. Let $(i,j)$th element of $T$ is denoted by $T_{i,j}$. Now for all off diagonal entries $T_{j,i}=T_{i,j}$. So there are $\frac{d^2-d}2$ many real numbers which decides $T$ uniquely apart from the $d$ entries in the diagonal. Therefore,  there are total $\frac{d^2-d}2$ many off-diagonal entries which participates in uniquely deciding $T$. Hence there are total $$ \frac{d^2-d}2+d=\frac{d^2+d}{2}=\frac{d(d+1)}2$$ real numbers which uniquely decides $T$. Hence $\dim(\sR(\mcH))= d^2$.

\solve{
In any operator of $\sD(\mcH)$ there are $^2$ entries in the matrix of the operator. But density operator also has one extra condition which is its trace equal's to 1. Hence sum of the diagonal entries is 1. Hence for the diagonal entries it is enough to know about the $d-1$ entries instead of the all $d$ entries because the last entry will be decided by the other $d-1$ entries as their sum is 1. Except the diagonal there are total $d^2-d$ many off diagonal entries. Hence to uniquely characterize a operator in $\sD(\mcH)$ at most $(d^2-d)+(d-1)=d^2-1$ many numbers are needed. Therefore the set of operators, $\sD(\mcH)$ can be embedded into a real vector space of dimension $n=d^2-1$.

Prove the Singular value decomposition theorem stated in class.	%Problem		
\end{problem}
\solve{We will first state the singular value decomposition theorem then we will prove it. \parinf 
	
\textbf{\textit{Singular Value Decomposition Theorem:}} Suppose $T:\mcH\to \mcH$ and $\dim(\mcH)=s$ then $\exs\ U,V\in \sL(H)$ which are unitary and diagonal $D\in \sL(\mcH)$  with non-negative entries so that $$T=UDV$$ 

\textbf{\textit{Proof:}} \parinn Suppose we have an ONB of $\mcH$, $\{\ket{e_i}\mid i\in[d]\}$ of $\mcH$. Let's denote $S=T^{\dagger}T$. Now $S$ is hermitian. Hence by spectral theorem there are unitary matrix $W$ and a diagonal matrix $\Lm$ such that $$S=W\Lm W^{\dagger}$$and also we get an orthonormal eigen basis $\{\ket{v_i}\mid i\in [d]\}\subseteq \mcH$ of $\mcH$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\{\lm_i\mid i\in [d]\}$ of $S$ which are the diagonal entries of $\Lm$. 

Now if $\lm$ is an eigenvalue of $S$ with corresponding eigenvector $\ket{v}$ then $$S\ket{v}=\lm \ket{v}\implies \lm \bra{v}\ket{v}=\bra{v}Sv=(Sv)^{\dagger}\ket{v}=\lm^{\dagger}\bra{v}\ket{v}$$Therefore the eigenvalues are real. Also since $$\lm \bra{v}\ket{v}=\bra{v}S\ket{v}=\bra{v}T^{\dagger}T\ket{v}=(T\ket{v})^{\dagger}(T\ket{v})\geq0$$ we have $\lm\geq 0$ since $\bra{v}\ket{v}\geq0$. Therefore eigenvalues of $S$ are real and non-negative. Therefore entries of $\Lm$ are non-negative.

Let us denote the $i$th eigenvalue of $\Lm$ as $\lm_i$. So now take $\sg_i=\triangleq \sqrt{\lm_i}$. Now create the diagonal matrix $\Sg$ with $i$th eigenvalue of $\Sg$ is $\sg_i$.  Define the vectors $\ket{u_i}=\frac{1}{\sg_i}T\ket{v_i}$ for all $i\in [d]$. Then $$\bra{u_i}\ket{u_j}=\frac1{\sg_i\sg_j}\bra{v_i}T^{\dagger}T\ket{v_j}=\frac1{\sg_i\sg_j}\bra{v_i}S\ket{v_j}=\frac1{\sg_i\sg_j}\bra{v_i}\lm_j\ket{v_j}=\frac{\lm_j}{\sg_i\sg_j}\bra{v_i}\ket{v_j}=\delta_{i,j}$$Hence $\{\ket{u_i}\mid i\in [d]\}$ also forms an orthonormal basis. 

Now we have two maps $V:\mcH\to \mcH$ and $U:\mcH\to \mcH$ which send the orthonormal basis $\{\ket{e_i}\mid i\in [d]\}$ to $\{\ket{v_i}\mid i\in [d]\}$ by $V\ket{e_i}=\ket{v_i}$ and $\{\ket{e_i}\mid i\in [d]\}$ to $\{\ket{u_i}\mid i\in [d]\}$ by $U\ket{e_i}=\ket{u_i}$. Therefore we have the matrix of $U,V$ are orthonormal. By definition of $u_i$ we have  $Tv_i=\sg_iu_i$ for all $i\in[d]$. Hence we have $$TV=U\Sg\implies T=U\Sg V^{\dagger}$$
