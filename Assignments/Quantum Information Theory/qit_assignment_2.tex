For $T:\mcH\to \mcH$, prove that  $$\sum_{i=1}^d\la e_i\ket{Te_i}=\sum_{i=1}^d \la f_i\ket{Tf_i}$$if $\{\ket{e_i}\in \mcH\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ and $\{\ket{f_i}\in \mcH\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ are ONB.

\solve{
	Let $S:\mcH\to \mcH$ where it maps the basis vectors from $\ket{e_i}\to \ket{f_i}$. Then $S\ket{e_i}=\ket{f_i}$. Hence $S$ is an orthonormal matrix since $$\bra{e_j}S^{\dagger}S\ket{e_i}=\bra{f_j}f_i\ra=\delta_{ji}\quad \text{and} \quad \bra{f_j}SS^{\dagger}\ket{f_i}=\bra{e_j}e_i\ra=\delta_{ji}$$Hence $$\sum_{i=1}^d \la f_i|Tf_i\ra =\sum_{i=1}^d \la e_i|S^{\dagger}TS\ket{e_i}=tr{(S^{\dagger}TS)}=tr(SS^{\dagger}T)=tr(T)=\sum_{i=1}^d\la e_i\ket{Te_i}$$Therefore we have $$\sum_{i=1}^d\la e_i\ket{Te_i}=\sum_{i=1}^d \la f_i\ket{Tf_i}$$

If $\{\ket{e_i}\in \mcH_1\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ and $\{\ket{f_i}\in \mcH_2\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ are ONB, then  $\{  \ket{e_i}\otimes \ket{f_j}\mid 1\leq i,j\leq d\}\subseteq \mcH_1\tensor \mcH_2$ is ONB
	%Problem		
\end{problem}

\solve{
	Let $\ket{\psi}\tensor \ket{\phi}\in \mcH_1\tensor \mcH_2$. Then $\ket{\psi}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^d\alpha_i\ket{e_i}$ where $\alpha_i\in \bbC$ for all $i\in [d]$ since $\{\ket{e_i}\in \mcH_1\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ is ONB for $\mcH_1$. Hence $$\ket{\psi}\tensor \ket{\phi}=\sum_{i=1}^d\alpha_{i}\ket{e_i}\tensor \ket{\phi}$$Now $\ket{\phi}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^d\beta_i\ket{f_i}$ where $\beta_i\in \bbC$ for all $i\in [d]$ since $\{\ket{f_i}\in \mcH_2\mid 1\leq i\leq d\}$ is ONB for $\mcH_2$. Hence $$\forall \ i\in [d]\ \ket{e_i}\tensor \ket{phi}=\sum_{j=1}^d\beta_j\ket{e_i}\tensor \ket{f_j}$$Thereofore we get $$\ket{\psi}\tensor \ket{\phi}=\sum_{i=1}^d\alpha_{i}\ket{e_i}\tensor \ket{\phi}=\sum_{i=1}^d\alpha_{i}\sum_{j=1}^d\beta_j\ket{e_i}\tensor \ket{f_j}=\sum_{1\leq i,j\leq d}\alpha_i\beta_j \ket{e_i}\tensor \ket{f_j}$$ Therefore $\{  \ket{e_i}\otimes \ket{f_j}\mid 1\leq i,j\leq d\}$ is a basis of $\mcH_1\tensor \mcH_2$. 
	
	Now for any $i1,i2,j1,j2\in [d]$ $$(\bra{e_{i1}}\tensor \bra{f_{j1}})(\ket{e_{i2}}\tensor\ket{f_{j2}})=\bra{e_{i1}}\ket{e_{i2}} \bra{f_{j1}}\ket{f_{j2}}=\delta_{i1,i2}\, \delta_{j1,j2}$$Therefore $\{  \ket{e_i}\otimes \ket{f_j}\mid 1\leq i,j\leq d\}$ is orthonormal. Therefore $\{  \ket{e_i}\otimes \ket{f_j}\mid 1\leq i,j\leq d\}$ is a ONB for $\mcH_1\tensor \mcH_2$.
