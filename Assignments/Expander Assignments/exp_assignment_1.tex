		Problem 4.9 (The Replacement Product): Pseudorandomness By Salil Vadhan
	}{p1% problem reference text
}
Given a $D_1$-regular graph $G_1$ on $N_1$ vertices and a $D_2$-regular graph $G_2$ on $D_1$ vertices consider the following graph $G_1\textcircled{r}G_2$ on vertex set $[N_1]\times [D_1]$: vertex $(u,i)$ is connected to $(v,j)$ iff \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $u=v$ and $(i,j)$ is an edge in $G_2$ or,
	\item $v$ is the $i$'th neighbour of $u$ in $G_1$ and $u$ is the $j$th neighbor of $v$. 
\end{enumerate}
That is, we ``replace" each vertex $v$ in $G_1$ with a copy of $G_2$, associating edge incident to $v$ with one vertex of $G_2$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that there is a function $g$ such that if $G_1$ has spectral expansion $\gm_1>0$ and $G_2$ has spectral expansion $\gm_2>0$ (and both graphs are undirected) then $G_1\textcircled{r}G_2$ has spectral expansion $g(\gm_1,\gm_2,D_2)>0$.
	
	[Hint: Note that $(G_1\textcircled{r}G_2)^3$ has $G_1\textcircled{z}G_2$ as a subgraph]
	\item Show how to convert an explicit construction of constant degree (spectral) expanders into an explicit construction of degree 3 (spectral) expanders.
	\item Without using Theorem 4.14, prove an analogue of Part 1 for edge expansion. That is, there is a function $h$ such that if $G_1$ is an $\lt(\frac{N_1}2,\eps_1\rt)$ edge expander and $G_2$ is a $\lt(\frac{D_1}2,\eps_2\rt)$ edge expander then $G_1\textcircled{r}G_2$ is a $\lt(\frac{N_1D_1}{2},h(\eps_1,\eps_2,D_2)\rt)$ edge expander where $h(\eps_1,\eps_2,D_2)>0$ if $\eps_1,\eps_2>0$. 
	
	[Hint: Given any set $S$ of vertices of $G_1\textcircled{r}G_2$, partition $S$ into the clouds that are more than ``half-full" and those that are not]
	\item Prove that the functions $g(\gm_1,\gm_2,D_2)$ and $h(\eps_1,\eps_2,D_2)$ must depend on $D_2$ by showing that $G_1\textcircled{r}G_2$ cannot be a $\lt(\frac{N_1D_1}2,\eps\rt)$ edge expander if $\eps>\frac1{D_1+1}$ and $N_1\geq 2$
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\solve{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ denote the normalized adjacency matrices of $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively. The degree of the new graph $G_1\textcircled{r}G_2$ is $D_2+1$. Now denote $B\triangleq I_{N_1}\otimes A_2$ and $A$ be a $N_1\cdot D_1\times N_1\cdot D_1$ matrix where $$A[(u,i),(v,j)]=\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{when $i$th neighbor of $u$ is $v$ and $j$th neighbor of $v$ is $u$ in $G_1$}\\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}$$Therefore the adjacency matrix of the graph $G_1\textcircled{r}G_1$ is $A+D_2B$. Therefore the normalized adjacency matrix, $M$ $$M\triangleq \frac{A+D_2B}{D_2+1}$$
	
	Now notice the graph $(G_1\textcircled{r}G_2)^3$ contains the graph $G_1\textcircled{z}G_2$ as a subgraph. Hence $$M^3=\lt[\frac{A+D_2B}{D_2+1}\rt]^3=\frac{D_2^2}{(D_2+1)^3}BAB+\lt[1-\frac{D_2^2}{(D_2+1)^3}\rt]C$$ for some matrix $C$. Lets denote $p\coloneqq \frac{D_2^2}{(D_2+1)^3}$. Then $M^3=pBAB+(1-p)C$. Hence for any $v\perp u$ where $u$ is the uniform vector we have $$\|M^3v\|\leq p\|BABv\|+(1-p)\|Cv\|$$
	
	Now we can think as $C$ is a normalized adjacency matrix of an undirected graph. Hence for all $v\perp u$ we have $\|Cv\|\leq \|v\|$. Now we know for all $v\perp u$ $$\|BABv\|\leq (\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)\|v\|$$ where $\lm_1=1-\gm_1$ and $\lm_2=1-\gm_2$. Hence $$\|M^3v\|\leq p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)\|v\|+(1-p)\|v\|=[p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)]\|v\|$$Suppose $\max\limits_{v\perp u}\frac{\|M^3v\|}{\|v\|}=\lm$. Then we have $\lm=(1-g(\gm_1,\gm_2,D_2))^3$. Therefore we have 
	\begin{multline*}
		\lm=\max\limits_{v\perp u}\frac{\|M^3v\|}{\|v\|}\leq \max\limits_{v\perp u}\frac{\|(pBAB+(1-p)C)v\|}{\|v\|}\\
		\leq \max\limits_{v\perp u}\frac{[p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)]\|v\|}{\|v\|}=[p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)]
	\end{multline*}
	Hence 
	 $$(1-g(\gm_1,\gm_2,D_2))^3\leq=[p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)] $$
	
	Now\begin{align*}
		1-[p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)] & = 1-(1-p)-p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)\\
		& =p-p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)\\
		& =p[1-(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)]
	\end{align*}Now we know $$\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2<1\iff 0<1-(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)<1\qquad \text{and}\qquad 0<p<1$$Then $0<p[1-(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)]<1$. Hence $$0<p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)<1$$ Now 
	\begin{align*}
		1-g(\gm_1,\gm_2,D_2) & =\lt[p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)\rt]^{\frac13}    \\
		                     & = \lt[1- p[1-(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)] \rt]^{\frac13} \\
		                     & \leq 1-\frac13 p[1-(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)]<1
	\end{align*}So $$g(\gm_1,\gm_2,D_2)=1-	\lt[p(\lm_1+\lm_2+\lm_2^2)+(1-p)\rt]^{\frac13} >0$$
	\item First we will prove some  lemmas
	
	\textbf{\textit{Lemma 1:}} Eigenvalues of the permutation $\sg\in S_n$ where $\sg=(12\cdots n)$ are all the $n$-th roots of unity.
	
	\textbf{\textit{Proof:}} The permutation matrix of $\sg$ is $$P=\mat{0& 1\\ I_{n-1} & 0}$$
	Now by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulant_matrix}{Wikipedia: Circulant Matrix} Any circulant matrix looks like $${\displaystyle C={\begin{bmatrix}c_{0}&c_{n-1}&\cdots &c_{2}&c_{1}\\c_{1}&c_{0}&c_{n-1}&&c_{2}\\\vdots &c_{1}&c_{0}&\ddots &\vdots \\c_{n-2}&&\ddots &\ddots &c_{n-1}\\c_{n-1}&c_{n-2}&\cdots &c_{1}&c_{0}\\\end{bmatrix}}}$$Hence $P$ is a circulant matrix with $c_0=0$, $c_1=1$ and for all $i\in [n]-\{1\}$, $c_i=0$. Hence from the same reference we get that for all $j\in [n-1]\cup \{0\}$, the  $j$th eigenvalue $\lm_j$ is $${\displaystyle \lambda _{j}=c_{0}+c_{1}\omega ^{j}+c_{2}\omega ^{2j}+\dots +c_{n-1}\omega ^{(n-1)j}}=\om^j$$ where $\om=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}}$. Hence the eigenvalues of $P$ are the $n$-th roots of unity.\qed
	
	\textbf{\textit{Lemma 2:}} A $k$-cycle graph is a $\lt(k,2,1-\Theta\lt(\frac1{k^2}\rt)\rt)$-expander.
	
	\textbf{\textit{Proof:}} Let $P_k$ denote the matrix  $$P_k=\mat{0& 1\\ I_{k-1} & 0}$$The the adjacency matrix of $k$-cycle is just $M=P_k+P_k^T$. Since $P_k$ is unitary matrix Let $S$ be the matrix such that $SP_kS^{\dagger}$ is diagonalized. Let's denote that $D$.  Then $$SMS^{\dagger}=S(P_k+P_k^{\dagger})S^{\dagger}=SP_kS^{\dagger}+SP_k^{\dagger}S^{\dagger}=D+S(SP_k)^{\dagger}=D+(SP_kS^{\dagger})^{\dagger}=D+D^{\dagger}$$Hence the eigenvalues of $M$ are $2\Re(\om^j)$ for all $j\in [n]$ where $\om = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{k}}$
	
	Now the normalized adjacency matrix for the $k$-cycle is $\frac12M$. Hence the eigenvalues for the normalized adjacency matrix are $\Re(\om^j)=\cos\frac{2j\pi}{k}$ for all $j\in [k]$. Hence the second largest eigenvalue is when $j=1$ i.e.  $$ \cos\frac{2\pi}{k}\geq 1-\frac12\lt(\frac{2\pi}{k}\rt)^2=1-\frac{2\pi^2}{k^2}=1-\frac{1}{\Theta(k^2)}$$Therefore $k$-cycle is $1-\frac{1}{\Theta(k^2)}$ expander. \qed
	
	\parinn Now we will show an explicit construction of degree 3 expanders from an constant degree expanders. Let $G$ be an $(N,D,\lm)$-expander. Take $H$ to be a $D$-cycle. Hence by the Lemma 2 we have $H$ is a $\lt(D,2,1-\frac1{\Theta(D^2)}\rt)$-expander. Take the graph $G'=G\textcircled{r}H$. $G'$ is a $3$ regular graph. Hence $G'$ is a $(ND,3,\lm')$-expander where $1-\lm'>0$ by part (1). Hence $G'$ is a degree 3 expander.

		Problem 4.10 (Unbalanced Vertex Expanders and Data Structures): Pseudorandomness By Salil Vadhan
	}{p2% problem reference text
	}
	Consider a $(K,(1-\eps)D)$ bipartite vertex expander $G$ with $N$ left vertices, $M$ right vertices and left degree $D$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For a set $S$ of left vertices, a $y\in N(S)$ is called a \textit{unique} neighbor of $S$ if $y$ is incident to exactly one edge from $S$. Prove that every left-set $S$ of size at most $K$ has at least $(1-2\eps)D|S|$ unique neighbors.
		\item For a set $S$ of size at most $\frac{K}2$, prove that at most $\frac{|S|}2$ vertices outside $S$ have at least $\delta D$ neighbors in $N(S)$ for $\delta=O(\eps)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\solve{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $U$ be the set of unique neighbors in $N(S)$. Denote $T=\Gm(S)-U$. Then we have $|U\cup T|\geq (1-\eps)D|S|$. Now we will count the number of edges between $S$ and $\Gm(S)$. From each vertex in $S$ there are $D$ edges going out. Hence total $D|S|$ many edges are going out from $S$. Now in $\Gm(S)$ for each vertex in $U$ there is exactly one edge coming from $S$ and for each edge in $T$ there are at least 2 edges coming from $S$. Hence there are at least $|U|+2|T|$ many edges are coming towards $\Gm(S)$. Hence we have:
	
	\begin{multline*}
		|U|+2|T|\leq D|S|\iff |U|+2(|\Gm(S)|-|U|)\leq D|S|\\
		\iff |U|\geq 2|\Gm(S)|-D|S|\geq (1-\eps)D|S|-D|S|=(1-2\eps)D|S|
	\end{multline*}Hence there are at least  $(1-2\eps)D|S|$ unique neighbors.
