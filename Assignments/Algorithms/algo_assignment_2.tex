Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed acyclic graph $G=(V,E)$. Additionally, you are given a nonnegative, integral weight $w_e$ on each edge $e\in E$, and two special vertices $s,t\in V$. Give an algorithm to find a max-weight path from $s$ to $t$.

In class, we showed that if $(S,\mcI)$ is a matroid, then for any nonnegative weights $w$ no the  elements of $S$, the greedy algorithm obtains a maximum weight independent set. Show that this is only true if $(S,\mcI)$ a matroid. That is, for a fixed downward-closed set system $(S,\mcI)$, if the greedy algorithm obtains a maximum weight element of $\mcI$ for every assignment of nonnegative weights to elements of $S$, then $(S,\mcI)$ is a matroid.

Let us modify the ``cut rule" (in the implementation of decrease-key operation for a Fibonacci heap) to cut a node $x$ from its parent as soon as it loses its 3rd child. Recall that the rule that we studied in class was when a node loses its 2nd child. Can we still upper bound the maximum degree of a node of an $n-$node Fibonacci heap with $O(\log n)$.

The following are Fibonacci-heap operations: \textit{extract-min}$(\cdot)$, \textit{decrease-key}$(\cdot,\cdot)$, and also \textit{create-node}$(x,k)$ which creates a node $x$ in th root list with key value $k$. Show a sequence of these operations that results in a Fibonacci heap consisting of just one tree that is a linear chain of $n$ nodes.
