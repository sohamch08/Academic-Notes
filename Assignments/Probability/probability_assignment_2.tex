Suppose $X,Y$ and $U$ are mutually independent, such that $X$ and $Y$ are each exponentially distributed with some common parameter $\lm>0$ and $U$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$. Express $\bbP\{X<U<Y\}$ in terms of $\lm$. Simplify your answer.
\end{problem}
\solve{
$X$ and $Y$ are exponentially distributed with some common parameter $\lm>0$. Hence $F_X(x)=1- e^{-\lm x}$ and $F_Y(y)=1- e^{-\lm y}$ for some $x,y\geq 0$.and $U$ is uniform on $[0,1]$. So \begin{align*}
	\bbP[X<U<Y] & =\int_0^1\bbP[X< u, Y>u]du\\
	& = \int_0^1\bbP[X<u]\cdot \bbP[Y>u]du\\

	& = \int_0^1\lt(1-e^{-\lm u}\rt)e^{-\lm u}du\\
	& = \int_0^1 \lt[e^{-\lm u}-e^{-2\lm u}\rt]du\\
	& = \lt[\frac{e^{-\lm u}}{-\lm}-\frac{e^{-2\lm u}}{-2\lm}\rt]_0^1\\
	& = \lt[\frac{e^{-2\lm }}{2\lm}-\frac{e^{-\lm }}{\lm}\rt]-\lt[\frac{1}{2\lm}-\frac{1}{\lm}\rt] = \frac{\lt(e^{-\lm}\rt)^2-2e^{-\lm}+1}{2\lm}= \frac{\lt(e^{-\lm}-1\rt)^2}{2\lm}

Consider a packet switch with some number

on different input ports, and each is routed toward an output port. Assume the
choices of output ports are mutually independent, and for each packet, each
output port has equal probability.\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Specify a probability space $(\Om,\mcF,\bbP)$ to describe this situation.
	\item Let $X_i$ denote the number of packets routed to output port $i$ for $1\leq i\leq 8$. Describe the joint pmf of $X_1,\dots,X_8$.

Let $X$ have the CDF shown.

\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Find $\bbP[X\leq 0.8]$
	\item Find $\bbE[X]$
	\item Find $\Var [X]$
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\solve{
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $\bbP[X\leq 0.8]=\bbF_X[0.8]=0.5$ since the value of $F_X$ increases when $X\geq 1$. 
	\item $F_X(x)=\begin{cases}
		0&\text{when $x\leq 0$}\\
		0.5 & \text{when} 0\leq x\leq 1\\
		0.5+\frac{x-1}2 & \text{when } 1\leq x\leq 2\\
		1& \text{when }x\geq 2
	\end{cases}$ 

Hence \begin{align*}
	\bbE[X]& =\int_0^{\infty}[1-F_X(x)]dx=\int_0^1[1-0.5]dx+\int_1^2\lt[1-0.5-\frac{x-1}2\rt]dx+\int_2^{\infty}[1-1]dx\\
	& =\int_0^10.5dx+\int_1^2\lt[0.5-\frac{x-1}2\rt]dx\\
	& = 0.5+\lt[0.5x-\frac{(x-1)^2}{4}\rt]^2_1= 1-\frac14=\frac34
\end{align*}
	\item Take $Y=X^2$ and the distribution function for $Y$ is $F_Y$. Now for any $y\geq 0$ $$F_Y(y)=\bbP[Y^2\leq y]=\bbP[X^2\leq y]=\bbP[X\leq \sqrt{y}]=F_X(\sqrt{y})$$
	Therefore $$F_Y(y)=\begin{cases}
		0&\text{when $x\leq 0$}\\
		0.5 & \text{when} 0\leq x\leq 1\\
		0.5+\frac{\sqrt{y}-1}2 & \text{when } 1\leq y\leq 4\\
		1& \text{when }y\geq 4
	\end{cases}$$Hence \begin{align*}
	\bbE[X^2] &  =\int_0^{\infty}[1-F_Y(y)]dy=\int_0^1[1-0.5]dy+\int_1^4\lt[1-0.5-\frac{\sqrt{y}-1}2\rt]dy+\int_4^{\infty}[1-1]dy\\
	& = \int_0^10.5dy+\int_1^4\lt[0.5-\frac{\sqrt{y}-1}{2}\rt]dy\\
	& = 0.5+\lt[ 0.5y-\frac{\frac23y^{\frac32}-y}{2} \rt]_1^4=0.5+3\cdot 0.5-\lt[ \frac{\frac234^{\frac32}-4}{2} - \frac{\frac231^{\frac32}-1}{2}\rt] =2 -\frac56=\frac{7}6
\end{align*}
So $\Var[X]=\bbE[X^2]-\bbE[X]=\frac{7}{6}-\frac9{16}=\frac{56-27}{48}=\frac{29}{48}$.
