	This is also known as the \textit{inclusion-exclusion} principle.
	\item  \textit{Bonferroni inequalities} state that the sum of the first terms in the right-hand side of the identity we proved above is alternately an upper bound and a lower bound for the left-hand side. i.e., for odd $k \leq n$,
	$$
	P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) \leq S_1-S_2+\ldots+S_k
	$$
	and for even $k \leq n$
	$$
	P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) \geq S_1-S_2+\ldots-S_k
	$$
	
	Note that from what we showed above Bonferroni inequality holds with equality for $k=n$.
	
	Prove Bonferroni inequalities. Observe that the case of $k=1$ is what you know as the \textit{union bound} or Boole's inequality.

Prove or disprove the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The conditional independence of $A$ and $B$ given $C$ implies $A$ and $B$ are independent.
	\item  Independence of $A$ and $B$ implies the conditional independence of $A$ and $B$ given $C$.
\end{itemize}

If you disproved either of the claims above, for which events $C$ is it then the case that the following statement holds: for all events $A$ and $B$, the events $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ are independent.\end{problem}

Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of events. Define
$$
B_n=\bigcup_{m=n}^{\infty} A_m \quad C_n=\bigcap_{m=n}^{\infty} A_m
$$

Clearly $C_n \subseteq A_n \subseteq B_n$. Also, the sequences $\left\{B_n\right\}$ and $\left\{C_n\right\}$ are decreasing respectively. Let
$$
B=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{m \geq n} A_m \quad C=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{m \geq \mathrm{n}} A_m
$$

The events $B$ and $C$ are denoted by $\limsup _{n \rightarrow \infty} A_n$ and $\liminf _{n \rightarrow \infty} A_n$ respectively. Show that
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $B=\left\{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A_n\right.$ for infinitely many values of $\left.n\right\}$.
	\item $C=\left\{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A_n\right.$ for all but finitely many values of $\left.n\right\}$.
\end{enumerate}	
	We say that a sequence $\left\{A_n\right\}$ converges to a limit $A$ if $B$ and $C$ are the same set $A$. We denote this by $A_n \rightarrow A$. Suppose this is the case, then show that
	
	\begin{enumerate}[resume, label=(\alph*)]
		\item $A$ is an event.
	\item $P\left(A_n\right) \rightarrow P(A)$.
\end{enumerate} 

\end{problem}
\solve{
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item Let $\om\in B$. Then $\om\in \bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup\limits_{m\geq n}A_m$. Hence $\om \in \bigcup\limits_{m\geq n}A_m$ forall $n\in\bbN$. Hence $\om \in A_k$ for some $k\in \bbN$. Let $k_1$ be the least number such that $\om \in A_{k_1}$. Then we also have $\om \in B_{k_1+1}$. So we have some $k_2\geq k_1+1$ such that  $\om \in A_{k_2}$. Then $\om in B_{k_2+1}$. So there exists $k_3\geq k_2+1$ such that $\om \in A_{k_3}$. Continuing like this at $i^{th}$ step we have some $k_{i+1}\geq k_i+1$ such that $\om \in A_{k_{i+1}}$ and so on. So now we got an strictly increasing infinite sequence of positive integers $\lt\{k_1,k_2,k_3\dots,k_{i},\dots\rt\}$ such that $\om \in A_{k_j}$ for all $j\in\bbN$. Hence $\om \in \left\{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A_n\text{ for infinitely many values of }n\right\}$. Hence $$B\subseteq \left\{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A_n\text{ for infinitely many values of }n\right\}$$

% Problem 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}{%problem statement

 $10 \%$ of the surface of a sphere is coloured white, the rest is black. Show that, irrespective of the manner in which the colours are distributed, it is possible to inscribe a cube in $S$ with all its vertices black.

\textbf{Hint}: For a given distribution of colors, select the cube``uniformly randomly" (you should make this more concrete). First note that it is enough to prove that there is a non-zero probability with which all the vertices of this random cube are colored black (why?). Now try to use the union bound from Problem 1(b) above to show this.
\end{problem}
\solve{
To show that there exists a cube in $S$ with all its vertices black it is enough to show that if a random cube is chosen in $S$ the probability of all vertices black is greater than 0. Now we have $$\underset{\substack{C:\ cube\\ C\text{ is in $S$}}}{\bbP}[\text{All vertices of $C$ is black}]=1-\underset{\substack{C:\ cube\\ C\text{ is in $S$}}}{\bbP}[\text{At least one of the vertices of $C$ is white}]$$So its is enough to show that $\underset{\substack{C:\ cube\\ C\text{ is in $S$}}}{\bbP}[\text{At least one of the vertices of $C$ is white}]<1$. Now we also have \begin{align*}
	\underset{\substack{C:\ cube\\ C\text{ is in $S$}}}{\bbP}[\text{At least one of the vertices of $C$ is white}]
	=\underset{\substack{X_i\in S\\ \forall\ i\in[8]}}{\bbP}\lt[ \exs\ i\in[8]\text{ $X_i$ is colored white}\mid X_1,\dots,X_8 \text{ forms a cube} \rt]\\
\end{align*}
Now by Union Bound we have \begin{multline*}
	\underset{\substack{X_i\in S\\ \forall\ i\in[8]}}{\bbP}\lt[ \exs\ i\in[8]\text{ $X_i$ is colored white}\mid X_1,\dots,X_8 \text{ forms a cube} \rt]\\
	\leq  \sum_{j=1}^8\underset{\substack{X_i\in S\\ \forall\ i\in[8]}}{\bbP}\lt[X_j\text{ is colored white}\mid   X_1,\dots,X_8 \text{ forms a cube}\rt]
\end{multline*}

So now showing $$ \sum_{j=1}^8\underset{\substack{X_i\in S\\ \forall\ i\in[8]}}{\bbP}\lt[X_j\text{ is colored white}\mid   X_1,\dots,X_8 \text{ forms a cube}\rt]<1$$ is enough. Now for any $j\in[8]$, $$\underset{\substack{X_i\in S\\ \forall\ i\in[8]}}{\bbP}\lt[X_j\text{ is colored white}\mid   X_1,\dots,X_8 \text{ forms a cube}\rt]=\underset{\substack{X_i\in S\\ \forall\ i\in[8]}}{\bbP}\lt[X_j\text{ is colored white}\rt]=\frac{1}{10}$$The last equality because $X_j$ is colored white if it is a point picked from the $10\%$ area of the sphere which is colored white and the probability of that is $\frac1{10}$.Therefore we have $$\sum_{j=1}^8\underset{\substack{X_i\in S\\ \forall\ i\in[8]}}{\bbP}\lt[X_j\text{ is colored white}\mid   X_1,\dots,X_8 \text{ forms a cube}\rt]=\sum_{j=1}^8\frac1{10}=\frac{8}{10}<1$$Therefore we have $\underset{\substack{C:\ cube\\ C\text{ is in $S$}}}{\bbP}[\text{At least one of the vertices of $C$ is white}]<1\implies \underset{\substack{C:\ cube\\ C\text{ is in $S$}}}{\bbP}[\text{All vertices of $C$ is black}]>0$. Which means there exists a cube in $S$ with all vertices black
