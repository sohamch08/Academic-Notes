}
Let $n>0$. Consider a directed graph on partitions of $n$ (with the parts sorted by size). There is a (directed) edge from a partition to another if the latter can be obtained from the former by moving a "unit" from a part to the one immediately after, while maintaining the order. For example, there is an edge from the partition $25=10+6+4+3+2$ to $25=10+5+5+3+2$ as a "unit" is moved from 6 to 4 and it does not change the order of the parts, but no edge vice-versa. Similarly, there is an edge from the partition $25=10+6+4+3+2$ to $25=10+6+4+3+1+1$. Characterize all the sink partitions (those without any outgoing edges) that can be by starting from the partition $n=n$ (with only one part) and following these edges.

Consider a tournament with $k$ teams. Each team gets a rank at the end of the tournament, possibly allowing for ties. For example, if there are 5 teams, team 3 may be first, teams 1, 4 maybe tied second, and teams 2, 5, may be tied third. Compute an explicit formula for the exponential generating function of $R(k)$ for the number of rankings, assuming that $R(0)=1$.

Let $(U, \leq)$ be poset and $M$ be a square matrix with rows and columns indexed by $U$ such that the $(x, y)$-th entry of $M$ is $\mathbb{1}(x \leq y)$.\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
	\item Show that $M$ is invertible.
	\item Compute the inverse of $M$ when $(U, \leq)$ is the divisibility poset for positive integers at most $n$ (for some fixed $n$ ) and use it to derive the MÃ¶bius inversion formula.

Let $k, p>0$ be integers where $p$ is prime. A seller has $k p$ marbles, where marble $i \in[k p]$ costs \rupee$i$, that he is trading. Call a trade "divisible" if both the cost and the number of marbles sold is a multiple of $p$ (selling no marbles is one such trade). How many divisible trades are there? Write your answer in terms of $p$-th roots of unity.

A graph is a thunderstorm graph if every connected component is either a cycle (clouds) or a path (lightning bolts) or isolated vertices (raindrops). Compute an explicit formula, i.e., a formula without summation signs, for the exponential generating function of:
\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
	\item The number of connected thunderstorm graphs on the vertex set $[n]$.
	\item The number of thunderstorm graphs on the vertex set $[n]$.
\end{itemize}
