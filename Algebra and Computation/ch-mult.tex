\dfnc{Multiplication Time Function: $M(n)$}{The function $M:\bbN\to \bbR_{+}$ for any commutative ring $R[x]$ is called multiplication time function for if polynomials in $R[x]$ of degree less than $n$ can be multiplied using at most $M(n)$ operations in $R$.\parinn

Similarly we can define the function $M$ as above for multiplication time for $\bbZ$ if two integers of length $n$ bits can be multiplied using at most $M(n)$ operations}
