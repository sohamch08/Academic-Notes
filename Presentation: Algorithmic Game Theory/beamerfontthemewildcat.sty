% This file defines the font theme "wildcat" for the beamer class in LaTeX.
% It sets the fonts used for the title, author, frametitle, and section headings.
% The font families are created from OTF fonts located in the "fonts" directory.
% The Campton font family is used for the title and frametitle, while the Campton Light font family is used for the author and section headings.
% The AkkuratPro font family is used as the sans font, and the TeX Gyre Cursor font is used as the mono font.
% Make sure to have the required OTF font files in the correct relative directory or update the font paths accordingly.
