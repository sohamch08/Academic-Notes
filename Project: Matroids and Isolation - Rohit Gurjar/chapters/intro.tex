\dfn{Incidence Matrix}{For an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ the Incidence Matrix, $M$ of $G$ is the $|V|\times |E|$ matrix where for every $v\in V$ and $e\in E$, the entry $M[v,e]=1$ if the edge $e$ is incident on $v$ and otherwise 0}
\begin{Theorem}{}{}
	If $G=(V,E)$ is an undirected graph with $|V|=n$ then $G$ is connected if and only if $\rk(M)=n-1$
\end{Theorem}

\end{proof}
\begin{corolary}{}{}
	If $G=(V,E)$ is an undirected graph with $k$ connected components then $\rk(M)=n-k$
\end{corolary}
\dfn{Fundamental Cycles}{}
\begin{Theorem}{}{}
	The Incidence vectors of the  fundamental cycles for a spanning tree in the graph forms a basis of the null space of the incidence matrix
