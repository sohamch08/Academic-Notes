	abstract = {Given two matroids on the same ground set, the matroid intersection problem asks to find a common independent set of maximum size. We show that the linear matroid intersection problem is in quasi-NC2. That is, it has uniform circuits of quasi-polynomial size nO(logn), and O(log2 n) depth. This generalizes the similar result for the bipartite perfect matching problem. We do this by an almost complete derandomization of the Isolation lemma for matroid intersection. Our result also implies a blackbox singularity test for symbolic matrices of the form A0+A1 z1 +A2 z2+ …+Am zm, where A0 is an arbitrary matrix and the matrices A1,A2,…,Am are of rank 1 over some field.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a linear relaxation of the matroid matching problem, called the fractional matroid matching problem. When the matroid matching problem is in fact a matroid intersection problem, the fractional matroid matching polytope and the matroid matching polytope coincide. When the matroid matching problem is in fact a matching problem in a graph, the fractional matroid matching polytope and the classic fractional matching polytope of the graph coincide. Thus, the fractional matroid matching polytope may properly contain the matroid matching polytope. The fractional matroid matching polytope is a lattice polyhedron and, although its extreme points are not all integral, they are half-integral. This paper establishes strong relationships between extreme points of the fractional matroid matching polytope and those of graphic fractional matching polyhedra. Despite these strong relationships, adding the rank 1 inequalities does not define the matroid matching polytope. In fact, even the matching polytope of a graphic matroid is not generally described by adding these inequalities.}
